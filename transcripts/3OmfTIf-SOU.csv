0,"- [Instructor] You've
broken your program down",0.15,1.14
0,"into functions, but now maybe
you have 100's of functions,",1.29,3.63
0,"and a team of programmers
is in there every day",4.92,2.94
0,making changes to the code.,7.86,2.04
0,"With all of these moving
pieces, how is it possible",9.9,2.64
0,that this program isn't constantly broken?,12.54,2.67
0,The secret? Testing.,15.21,2.04
0,"Tests can come in many forms,",17.25,2.01
0,"like performance tests
or end-to-end tests.",19.26,2.61
0,But the most common is unit testing.,21.87,2.73
0,"Unit tests test a single unit
of functionality at a time.",24.6,3.81
0,"In most cases, that unit is a function.",28.41,3.03
0,"With unit tests, we can
define the requirements",31.44,2.22
0,for a function in code.,33.66,2.01
0,"For example, my unit test might validate",35.67,2.04
0,"that when I call my function
with the arguments 5 wheat",37.71,2.88
0,"and 1 ore that I get
the return value false.",40.59,4.2
0,"If that assertion is correct
and I do get back false,",44.79,3.75
0,then the test passes.,48.54,1.473
0,"But if we get a different return
value from the one the test",51.36,3.57
0,"expects, then the test fails.",54.93,2.733
0,Teams can automate their unit test to run,59.31,2.19
0,"anytime someone makes a
change to the function",61.5,2.64
0,"and they can block that
change from being submitted",64.14,2.43
0,until all the related unit tests pass.,66.57,3.0
0,This effectively enforces the requirements,69.57,2.79
0,"so programmers don't
accidentally break things",72.36,2.49
0,when they make a change.,74.85,1.89
0,"Either we fix the function
to make the unit test pass,",76.74,3.87
0,or if we thought twice about it,80.61,1.83
0,and we're confident that it's safe,82.44,1.68
0,"to change the requirements,
then we can update the unit test",84.12,3.36
0,to reflect that new expected behavior,87.48,2.34
0,"and submit that along
with our code change.",89.82,2.73
0,"That way the unit tests
stay a living contract",92.55,2.64
0,of the functions requirements.,95.19,2.4
0,But how do I know which tests to write?,97.59,2.55
0,"Writing just one test case
doesn't really do a whole lot",100.14,3.12
0,because my unit test would still pass,103.26,2.37
0,"even if my function just
always returned four.",105.63,3.12
0,"So I haven't really proven
anything about my function logic.",108.75,3.96
0,"I could write a test for
every possible input value,",112.71,3.39
0,"but that's probably not the
most efficient use of my time.",116.1,3.27
0,"Instead, programmers try and work",119.37,1.59
0,for a goal of code coverage.,120.96,2.16
0,"As a whole, we want our test
cases to execute every possible",123.12,3.6
0,path of execution through the function.,126.72,2.55
0,"So we try and identify
different classes of inputs,",129.27,2.91
0,and write a test case for each of those.,132.18,2.58
0,"For example, with our
get_route_score function",134.76,2.22
0,we would at least want a test case,136.98,1.65
0,for each of these conditional branches.,138.63,2.52
0,So our classes of inputs would be,141.15,1.83
0,"less than or equal to 2
trains, 3 trains, 4 trains,",142.98,3.42
0,and greater than or equal to 5 trains.,146.4,2.49
0,"With those representative
inputs we've anticipated",148.89,2.85
0,and proven out all the reasonable ways,151.74,2.37
0,that someone might call our function.,154.11,2.37
0,"Of course, the testing
process isn't always perfect.",156.48,3.3
0,"We may miss a test case,",159.78,1.5
0,"or we might make
compromises on code coverage",161.28,2.91
0,in the interest of time.,164.19,1.71
0,"If we do find a bug later,
we just wanna make sure",165.9,2.55
0,we learn from that mistake.,168.45,1.65
0,So most programming teams will go back in,170.1,2.31
0,and add a test for that exact failure case,172.41,2.49
0,"to enforce that the same
bug never happens twice.",174.9,3.063
0,"Okay, great, but how do I
actually write unit tests?",178.86,3.0
0,"The principles stay the same,",181.86,1.29
0,but the exact syntax varies,183.15,1.77
0,"depending on which unit
testing framework you use.",184.92,2.67
0,"in Python, many programmers
use the unittest module",187.59,2.85
0,or the pytest module.,190.44,1.92
0,Here's an example test suite,192.36,1.59
0,written with the unittest framework.,193.95,1.86
0,"I have seven test cases,",195.81,1.59
0,"and you can see that they're
basically all the same.",197.4,2.79
0,"I only change the name,
the argument I pass",200.19,2.25
0,"to the get_route_score function,",202.44,1.2
0,and the expected result I compare to.,203.64,2.76
0,"When I run it, I can see",206.4,1.05
0,that one of my test cases is failing.,207.45,2.25
0,"It tells me the name of
the failing test case",209.7,1.92
0,and the assertion that failed.,211.62,1.86
0,"Here I got the result -2
instead of the expected 0.",213.48,3.54
0,"So I know my function
must have a bug somewhere",217.02,3.24
0,because it doesn't work when I call it,220.26,1.83
0,with a negative argument.,222.09,1.95
0,"As you can see, a lot of unit testing code",224.04,3.09
0,is just boilerplate.,227.13,1.86
0,"That is, the same
repeated required syntax,",228.99,3.18
0,"so a lot of programmers
will just copy and paste",232.17,2.13
0,the boiler plate.,234.3,1.56
0,That means the secret to unit testing,235.86,1.62
0,isn't so much memorizing the syntax,237.48,1.89
0,"as it is learning how to
identify interesting test cases.",239.37,3.483
0,"If you're a beginner programmer
working independently",243.69,2.4
0,"just to learn, then I'll be
honest, it may not be worth it",246.09,4.35
0,"to write unit tests for all
your code at this point,",250.44,2.31
0,"because writing test code
can often take just as long",252.75,3.06
0,as it takes to write the program code.,255.81,2.31
0,"However, it is worth your time
to think about test cases.",258.12,4.23
0,"When you write or change a function,",262.35,1.83
0,"it's a good habit to call it
with a few different arguments",264.18,3.0
0,"to verify that it works as expected,",267.18,2.34
0,"even if you're not automating
that process with unit tests.",269.52,3.33
0,"That way as we build out
the rest of our program,",272.85,2.22
0,"we can have confidence that
the individual functions",275.07,2.49
0,"work correctly and when
we inevitably encounter",277.56,3.33
0,"an error later, we can
rule out those functions",280.89,2.46
0,as the cause of the bug.,283.35,1.353
